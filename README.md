## 📖 Overview
**Product Vision:** To eliminate the mental burden of medication management by creating a seamless safety tool that ensures no medication doses are missed.

## 🚩 Problem Statement
* **Adherence Issues:** Patients, especially the elderly, frequently forget to take their medications.
* **Inventory Gaps:** Users often don't realize they have run out of a prescription until a high-friction time (e.g., 9:00 PM on a Sunday).

## 🎯 Target Users
* **Patients:** specifically the elderly and those with complex "multiple Rx" regimens.
* **Caregivers:** those managing remote care who need visibility and support tools.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
An intelligent engine and mobile application that proactively manages medication schedules and inventory.

### Key UX & Design Features
* **Intelligent Reminders:** Alerts users to take medication and provides warnings when an Rx is about to run out or expire.
* **Customized Accessibility:** High-visibility design featuring large print and oversized buttons for ease of use.
* **Zero-Search Dashboard:** A simplified, single-view interface presenting vital information without requiring navigation.
* **Low Friction Input:** Emphasis on images and reduced writing to streamline the setup process.

### Color-Coded Status System
* 🟢 **GREEN:** No pending doses.
* 🟡 **YELLOW:** Pending dose (within the current time window).
* 🔴 **RED:** Missed dose, or medication is about to run out/expire.

## 🏆 Goals
1.  **Treatment Fidelity:** Ensure users remain strictly on track with their treatment regimen.
2.  **Health Performance:** Improve safety by avoiding ineffective (expired) prescriptions and preventing side effects.
3.  **Assist Caregivers:** Provide a reliable tool that assists caregivers in monitoring patient health remotely.

## 📈 Success Metrics
* **Growth:** Track the number of Downloads and Active Users.
* **Quality:** Monitor App Store Star Ratings.
* **Feedback:** Conduct surveys and collect direct feedback from caregivers and healthcare providers.
