# UI/UX Focus (Pair Role)

The driver in this project focuses on **UI/UX**. When working on this codebase:

## Prioritize

- **Layout and visual hierarchy**: Clear structure, spacing, and grouping (e.g. dashboard cards, medication list, reminder banner).
- **Accessibility**: Labels, focus order, ARIA where helpful, high-visibility mode, touch targets (see PRD: large print, oversized buttons).
- **Interaction**: Button placement, feedback (loading states, success/error), modals and flows that feel clear and low-friction.
- **Consistency**: Reuse existing patterns (e.g. `.btn`, `.card`, `.modal`) and tokens (`--primary`, `--muted`, etc.) from `css/styles.css`.

## Where to change things

- **Structure and semantics**: `index.html` – sections, headings, buttons, form labels, landmark roles.
- **Look and feel**: `css/styles.css` – layout, typography, colors, spacing, responsive behavior.
- **Behavior that affects UX**: `js/app.js` – when to show/hide UI, focus management, copy and error messages.

## When suggesting or implementing

- Prefer changes in HTML/CSS for purely visual or structural improvements; only touch JS when interaction or state is involved.
- Call out accessibility or usability impacts (e.g. contrast, tap targets, keyboard/escape).
- Keep the PRD in mind: zero-search dashboard, color-coded status, low-friction input, high-visibility option.
